Hi,

This is the GitHub repository for MrBayes, a program used for Bayesian
inference of phylogeny.

Build instructions, very very short version (would install MrBayes as
"/usr/local/bin/mb" on a Unix system):

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gmellison/DimethylBayes.git
    cd DimethylBayes
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install
