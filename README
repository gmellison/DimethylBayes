This is the GitHub repository for DimethylBayes, a for of MrBayes.  
DimethylBayes implements features useful for Bayesian inference 
of phylogenies from DNA methylation data. All functionality of 
MrBayes is included to enable combing model partitions of 
DNA methylation data with other datatypes and models included in 
MrBayes.  

Build instructions, very very short version (would install DimethylBayes as
"/usr/local/bin/mb" on a Unix system):

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gmellison/DimethylBayes.git
    cd DimethylBayes
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install
    src/dmb
