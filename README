This is the GitHub repository for DimethylBayes, a fork of 
MrBayes (https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes).    
DimethylBayes implements features useful for Bayesian inference 
of phylogenies from DNA methylation data. All functionality of 
MrBayes is included to enable combing model partitions of 
DNA methylation data with other datatypes and models included in 
MrBayes.  

Build instructions, very short version (would install DimethylBayes as
"/usr/local/bin/dmb" on a Unix system):

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gmellison/DimethylBayes.git
    cd DimethylBayes
    ./configure
    make && sudo make install
    src/dmb

Functions for the likelihood calculations for the DNA methylation substitution model 
are implemented in the `likelihood.c`, the prior distributions and moves 
for the new parameters are in `proposal.c`, and the handling of the new
datatype and parameters is in `model.c`  and `command.c`. New variables 
are declared in `bayes.h`, and the allocations for the read error likelihood calculation
are in mcmc.c. These changes have been flagged with a comment `/* ~DMB~ */`.

The three-state substitution model is enabled by setting the parameter `datatype=dimethyl;`
in the matrix command. The new parameters  
`readerrpr=fixed(0)` (the default) or `readerrpr=uniform(0,0.01)`.  
`methylratepr=fixed(1,2), `methylratepr=dirichlet(0.1,0.2);`
